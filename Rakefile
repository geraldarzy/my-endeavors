It was insane down there and it was so scary. At one point Mark, Gerald, Arzy and I deviated from the tour group and we got lost! We were roaming throough the catacombs like we were in a corn maze! Although it sounds fun in retrospect, it was actually really scary in the moment. Unforgettable experience. Drinking the next day was even better. Loved it. Need to do it again sometime.", pic: "https://www.novinite.com/media/images/2019-08/photo_verybig_199790.jpg", pic_caption: "Here's a picture of the eiffel tower. That's where we were!")

It was so contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source.",pic:"https://www.tmb.ie/wp/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Travel-health-tips-for-backpacking-Europe.jpg",pic_caption:"me and bae with our backpacks in front of the leaning tower of pizza")

There are two snowboard stances, regular and goofy. A regular stance means that your left foot is forward, while a goofy stance means that your right foot it forward. There is no correct snowboard stance, it is all about what feels good to you.",pic:"https://images.vailresorts.com/image/upload/c_scale,dpr_3.0,f_auto,q_auto,w_400/v1/Vail/Products/DAM%20Content%20Elements/20181017_VL_Milchev_004_1200x825.jpg",pic_caption:"Shredding that POW was so gnarly!")
    admin.endeavors << Endeavor.create(title:"Cliffjumping ",description:"Check out how deep the water is. You can do that by engaging in a little research on that particular river or lake or simply ask someone that can help you with this information. If you happen to be out in the wild and are in a situation when you have to jump- this is a movie-like scenario, but you never know-, here’s an interesting solution you could try: find some natural vegetation that could be used as a rope, tie it together and then tie a rock at the end of it. This way, by throwing the rock in the water, you will know approximatively how deep it is. If it is less than 4 meters, then it is not safe, so you should search for alternatives. Also, be aware of the tides in the area. If you are a good swimmer, you can try twisting in order to escape the currents.",pic:"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/cb/b4/2d/cbb42d399db19bbdf6a979014d8c2601.jpg",pic_caption:"This was the jump we were doing!")
